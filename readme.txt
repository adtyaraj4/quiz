# ⚡ QuantumLeap Quiz Engine

A futuristic browser quiz I made **just for fun** to experiment with animations, sound synthesis, and pure frontend development.

No frameworks. No backend. Just vibes and JavaScript 🚀

## 🎮 What it is

A single-page quiz app where you can:

* Pick a category
* Answer questions against a timer
* Hear cool synth sound effects
* See animated results

Everything runs directly in the browser.

## ✨ Why I built this

I wanted to play around with:

* Tailwind UI design
* Animations & micro-interactions
* Tone.js sound synthesis
* LocalStorage leaderboard
* Building a full app in **one HTML file**

Basically a small weekend project to experiment and have fun.
